      <h2>Hobbies</h2>
      <p>I enjoy a number of different hobbies, top of which is music production. I have been producing ambient flavours of electronic music since my late teens and have a lot of interest in analogue synthesisers, and a lot of love for the Ableton Live software. I have more recently been gaining interest in the realms of video and have been producing animated visuals using Resolume.</p>

      <p>When not playing around with audio and video, I do a lot of hobby programming and self-studying, mostly via Udemyâ€™s online courses. Of late most of my time has been spent learning various JS frameworks as well as experimenting with Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning ML techniques.</p>
