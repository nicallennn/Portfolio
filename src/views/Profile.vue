    <!-- about me -->
    <div class="about-me mt-5">
      <h2>Some things about me.</h2>
      <div>
        <p>I am a creative person with great passion for team working and problem solving. I learnt from a young age how to design and build using engineering principles and have 10 years work experience in the fields of Manufacturing Engineering, Audio Engineering and Technical Event Management.</p>

        <p>I have always had great interest in software development and have recently completed a BEng Software Engineering degree, awarded with First Class Honours by the University of Greenwich in June 2018. During my time at university I studied many technologies and programmed in a variety of languages including C, C#, Java, SQL, PHP, VHDL, ASM. In addition to this, I produced several web applications using the LAMP stack and have more recently been experimenting with various JavaScript technologies/frameworks such as Node, Vue, and React - backed by NoSql databases such as MongoDB.</p>

        <p>I am very much open to working with new technologies and am looking for the potential to grow from a graduate to an expert. As a new developer with no real commercial experience (I have done a few days work experience at a start-up, and completed a couple of websites for friends etc.), I would ideally be looking to enter into a position with some kind of training plan and mentorship. I am however very motivated and able to learn by myself, and therefore feel confident I would be able to get up to speed quickly, and be able to find solutions to problems independently if/when required.</p>

      <!-- hobbies -->
      <div class="hobbies mt-5">
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I enjoy a number of different hobbies, top of which is music production. I have been producing ambient flavours of electronic music since my late teens and have a lot of interest in analogue synthesisers, and a lot of love for the Ableton Live software. I have more recently been gaining interest in the realms of video and have been producing animated visuals using Resolume.</p>

        <p>When not playing around with audio and video, I do a lot of hobby programming and self-studying, mostly via Udemyâ€™s online courses. Of late most of my time has been spent learning various JS frameworks as well as experimenting with Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning ML techniques.</p>

      <!-- references -->
      <div class="references mt-5">
        <h2>References</h2>

        <p>I am able to provide both work and acedemic references upon request. I also have public references on my Zinc profile, found at: zinc.work/user/nicallennn.</p>
